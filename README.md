# cd-ify
Rediscover the lost art of album covers in full 3D:

# why
I feel like album covers and music art in general has been kind of unappreciated in their full form. There's a whole backside to the art that people have kind of forgotten about, and I think it's a cool part of the experience. On top of that, I just thought it'd be fun :)

# dev
Just your standard React + Vite project. Clone the project and run

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

in your terminal and you're a developer now!
There are some environment variables that are necessary and `env.example` help give a general outline.

This was possible thanks to the [discogs API](https://www.discogs.com/developers).
